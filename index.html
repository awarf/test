<h1>Neural Sleep Technology Redesigned! </h1>
</head>


<p> In the Neurofield Magnetic Stimulation lab, led by Dr. Jonathan Larson, we are currently testing a pulsed electromagnetic field (pEMF) device similar to the equipment used in sleep studies to treat clinical anxiety and depression. </p>

<p>Our aim to build safer, less intense pEMF technology that is just as effective as the current Repetitive Trans-cranial Magnetic Stimulation (RTMS) technology that was approved by the FDA to treat anxiety and depression. The Neurofield device is capable of generating an electromagnetic field from 100-200 milligoes and generate frequencies from 0.31 cycles per second to 300,000 cycles per second. In comparison, the Neurofield device is roughly 10 million times weaker than RTMS treatments. In other words, we're trying to test a device that is much weaker but thus far has proven just as effective as the current technology.</p>
	
<p>In the end, we desire to help advance neuro-technology to treat anxiety and depression with the same low intensity stimulation as the technology used for sleep studies. If our current lab proves Neurofield to be just as effective as less safe and higher intensity devices then we have achieved our goal. The benefits of sleep technology as a tool to further psychotherapy without side effects!</p>
